# FretStop Frontend
FretStop is a marketplace for buying and selling guitars. Users are able to browse through available guitars, add to their carts, checkout with a credit card, view past orders, and post guitars for sale. 

## Background
I made this application after completing [Wes Bos's Advanced React](https://advancedreact.com/) tutorial, which not only got me more familiar with React and Node.js, but also introduced me to Apollo 3/GraphQL, Keystone's Headless CMS, and Next.js. This application also includes authentication, permissions, sending email for password resets, uploading images with Cloudinary, and credit card transactions with Stripe.

I chose to build a similar application to what is shown in the tutorial to practice using this tech stack, with some differences in the style, schema, and user flow. Future releases will include a better sign in / login flow, design adjustments, and visibility of certain features based on logged in state.
